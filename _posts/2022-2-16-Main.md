Hi there, my name is Taylor Vaughan and I am a second-year undergraduate student at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Welcome to my website! This resource is meant to be a collection of personal and professional aspects of my life that are relevant to my current career path and future ambitions. My love for the environment and living things, combined with my passion for chemistry, pushed me to want to major in something that could combine the two. I am currently majoring in Biochemistry and planning on concentrating in Polymers and Coatings. I would love to be able to research and develop new sustainable materials that could help combat the plastic waste issue we have and allow for less waste pollution. Feel free to reach out through my various forms of communication linked!
