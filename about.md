I grew up Ventura, CA, a beach town about two hours south of San Luis Obispo. Growing up in such a beautiful place has allowed me to develop a love for the environment and being outside. Some of my favorite activities include hiking, going to the beach, watching sunset, hammocking, surfing, and picnicking; all very nature-oriented activities. In addition to loving the environment on my own, I always gravitated towards STEM classes throughout high school. When I took AP Chem and AP Environmental Science, I knew where I wanted to take my career. 


In addition to my outdoor activities, I love to take part in creative activities. I started thrifting almost all my clothes when I went into high school, it has now become my friends’ and I’s favorite activity to do together. In addition to thrifting, I have loved learning to crochet, making jewelry, painting with watercolors, taking film photos, and playing around with the guitar. Although I have trouble finding a lot of free time these days, these passions of mine never fail to brighten my day when I can fit them in.
